# Changelog rule

Whenever you make a code/config/docs change in this repo, also update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]`.

- Use Keep a Changelog headings: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed` (as applicable).
- Prefer short, user-facing bullets (what changed + why), not implementation details.
- If a change impacts analytics/consent/privacy, explicitly mention it.
